# Feature Development and Deployment Process

## Overview

When a Product Owner (PO) writes a new story in Jira, such as introducing a new feature in the app, the feature must go through several stages before it is deployed to production. These stages ensure that the developed feature meets the requirements and functions correctly. Multiple teams, including developers and testers, work on this feature across different environments. This document outlines the roles of these environments and the process of moving a feature from development to production using OpenShift.

## Environments

### 1. **Development (Dev) Environment**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - This environment is used for building and testing new features. 
     - Developers write and test code here.
   - **Why It’s Needed:** 
     - It provides a safe space for development without affecting real users.

### 2. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - This environment allows testers to simulate real customer interactions and verify that the feature meets business requirements.
   - **Why It’s Needed:** 
     - Advanced testing in UAT ensures that the feature is user-friendly and functional before release.

### 3. **Penetration Testing**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - Penetration testing is performed to identify security vulnerabilities in the feature.
   - **Environment:** 
     - This testing can be done in UAT, preprod, or a dedicated security environment.
   - **Why It’s Needed:** 
     - It ensures the feature is secure and ready to face real-world threats.

### 4. **Pre-Production (Preprod) Environment**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - This environment closely mirrors the production environment and serves as the final staging area.
   - **Why It’s Needed:** 
     - It allows for a final check to ensure everything is ready for production.

### 5. **Production (Prod) Environment**
   - **Purpose:** 
     - This is the live environment where the feature is available to real customers.
   - **Why It’s Needed:** 
     - It contains the code that users interact with, so it must be stable and bug-free.

## Why Multiple Environments Are Used

- **Risk Mitigation:** 
  - Having multiple environments reduces the risk of introducing bugs or security issues into production.
- **Role Specificity:** 
  - Each environment has a specific role (development, testing, final checks, etc.) to ensure the feature is fully prepared before going live.

## Deployment Process

1. **Feature Development:**
   - Developers create a new Git branch for the feature.
   - Code is written and tested in the Dev environment.
   - Upon completion, the feature is pushed, triggering a pipeline that automates the deployment to the Dev environment.

2. **Testing:**
   - The feature moves to the UAT environment for further testing.
   - Testers simulate real user interactions and conduct advanced testing to ensure the feature works as expected.

3. **Security Testing:**
   - Penetration testing is conducted to identify any security vulnerabilities.
   - This can occur in the UAT or a dedicated security environment.

4. **Final Staging:**
   - The feature is deployed to the Preprod environment for final checks.
   - This environment mirrors production to catch any last-minute issues.

5. **Production Deployment:**
   - If all tests pass, the feature is packaged (e.g., as a Docker container) and deployed to the Production environment.
   - This step makes the feature live and available to customers.

## Role of OpenShift

- **Environment Management:** 
  - OpenShift manages different environments, ensuring the app runs smoothly across Dev, UAT, Preprod, and Prod.
- **Automation:** 
  - OpenShift automates the deployment process, handling the movement of features from one environment to another.
- **Scaling:** 
  - OpenShift scales the app to handle varying user loads, ensuring consistent performance.

## Summary

The use of multiple environments allows teams to develop, test, and secure features thoroughly before releasing them to production. OpenShift plays a crucial role in managing these environments, automating the deployment process, and ensuring that the app performs well at each stage.
